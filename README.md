## Components
This plugin offer 2 components and 1 static page snippet.
* `galleriesList` component, display list of galleries
* `gallerySlug` component, display in a page a gallery based on his URL
* `galleryId` page snippet, display in a page a gallery based on his ID

### Galleries list

Use the `galleryList` component to display a list of latest galleries on a page. The component has the following properties:
* **galleryPage** - path to the gallery details page. The default value is galleries/gallery - it matches the pages/galleries/gallery.htm file in the theme directory. This property is used in the default component partial for creating links to the gallery images.
* **categoryPage** - path to the category page. The default value is galleries/category - it matches the pages/galleries/category.htm file in the theme directory. This property is used in the default component partial for creating links to the gallery images.
* **galleriesPerPage** - how many galleries to display on a single page (the pagination is supported automatically). The default value is 9.
* **pageNumber** - this value is used to determine what page the user is on, it should be a routing parameter for the default markup. The default value is {{ :page }} to obtain the value from the route parameter :page.
* **noGalleriesMessage** - message to display in on empty galleries list.

The galleryList component injects the following variables to the page where it's used:

* **galleries** - a list of galleries loaded from the database.
* **category** - the galleries category object loaded from the database. If the category is not found, the variable value is **null**.
* **galleryPage** - contains the value of the `galleryPage` component's property.
* **categoryPage** - contains the value of the `categoryPage` component's property.
* **pageParam** - contains the value of the current viewing page.
* **noPostsMessage** - contains the value of the `noPostsMessage` component's property.

The component supports pagination and reads the current page index from the :page URL parameter. The next example shows the basic component usage:

```twig	
title = "Show galleries"
url = "/galleries/:page?"
layout = "default"
is_hidden = 1

[viewBag]
localeUrl[fr] = "/galeries/:page?"
localeTitle[fr] = "Affiche une liste de galleries"

[galleriesList]
galleryPage = "galleries/gallery"
categoryPage = "galleries/category"
galleriesPerPage = 6
pageNumber = "{{ :page }}"
noGalleriesMessage = "No gallery found"
==
{% component 'galleriesList' %}
```
The next example shows the basic component usage with the category filter:

```twig
title = "Galleries Category"
url = "/galleries/category/:slug/:page?"

[galleriesList]
categoryFilter = "{{ :slug }}"
==
function onEnd()
{
    // Optional - set the page title to the category name
    if ($this->category)
        $this->page->title = $this->category->name;
}
==
{% if not category %}
    <h2>Category not found</h2>
{% else %}
    <h2>{{ category.name }}</h2>

    {% component 'galleriesList' %}
{% endif %}
```

The galleries and the pagination are coded in the default component partial `plugins/hounddd/lightgallery/components/galleries/default.htm`. If the default markup is not suitable for your website, feel free to copy it from the default partial and replace the {% component %} call in the example above with the partial contents.

### Gallery (by slug)
Use the `gallerySlug` component to display a gallery on a page.  
The component has the following properties:

* **inline** - the display mode of the gallery.
* **noImagesMessage** - message to display in an empty gallery.
* **plugins** - the plugins used by lightGallery script.
* **preload** - the number of preload slides.
* **mode** - the ype of transition between images.
* **speed** - the transition duration (in ms).
* **loop** - the ability to loop back to the beginning of the gallery from the last slide.
* **pause** - the the time (in ms) between each auto transition.
* **counter** - whether to show total number of images and index number of currently displayed image.
* **controls** - whether or not to display the prev/next buttons.
* **download** - whether or not to display the download button.
* **escKey** - whether the LightGallery could be closed by pressing the "Esc" key.
* **prevHtml** - custom html for prev control.
* **nextHtml** - custom html for next control.
* **width** - the width of the thumbnails to be displayed in the gallery.
* **height** - the height of the thumbnails to be displayed in the gallery.
* **resizer** - how the image should be fitted to dimensions.
* categoryPage - path to the category page. The default value is galleries/category - it matches the pages/galleries/category.htm file in the theme directory. This property is used in the default component partial for creating links to the gallery images.  

The gallerySlug component injects the following variables to the page where it's used:

* **gallery** - the gallery object loaded from the database. If the post is not found, the variable value is null.
* **noImagesMessage** - contains the value of the `noImagesMessage` component's property.

The next example shows the basic component usage on the gallery page:  

```twig
title = "Display a gallery"
url = "/gallery/:slug"
layout = "default"
is_hidden = 1

[viewBag]
localeUrl[en] = "/galerie/:slug"
localeTitle[fr] = "Affiche une galerie"

[gallerySlug]
slug = "{{:slug}}"
inline = "false"
noImagesMessage = "No images in this gallery"
plugins[] = "lgThumbnail"
plugins[] = "lgZoom"
preload = 2
mode = "lg-slide"
speed = 600
loop = "true"
pause = 5000
counter = "true"
controls = "true"
download = "true"
escKey = "true"
width = 300
height = 300
resizer = "auto"
==
{% component 'gallerySlug' %}
```

The gallery details are coded in the component partials wich are shared between `gallerySlug` component and `galleryId` page snippet.
* `plugins/hounddd/lightgallery/components/partials/gallery.htm` for thumbs view launching lightbox on click.
* `plugins/hounddd/lightgallery/components/partials/gallery_inline.htm` for inline lightbox view.
